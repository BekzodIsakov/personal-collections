-------

Collection app that lets create, update and delete collections of different
items. There're 3 types of users. Anauthenticated users can only view
collections. Authenticated users can control their collection while admin users
can authorize other users, such as enabling/disabling other admins and
blocking/unblocking users. The app also responds to different viewport sizes.

Each collection has a name, author, description and items. Each items has a
name, type and tags. Optional fields and values can be added to each item.

About This Project
This is a collections app where users can register and create collections of their favorite items, such as coins, shoes, books, or anything else they collect. Each collection includes a name, an image, a list of items, and various other details to make it more informative.

Users can interact by liking and commenting on collections and individual items. However, commenting requires registration‚Äîguests can only browse collections. Each user has full control over their own collections, allowing them to manage and update them as needed.

The app also features an admin system. Admins can be assigned or blocked by other admins and have the ability to view and edit user collections to maintain order and moderation.

Purpose
I built this project to showcase my skills, experiment with new technologies, and explore different features I‚Äôve been learning. It serves as both a learning experience and a portfolio piece to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers.
